Business Requirements
=======================

- A site that feels natural to navigate through. 
- Modern design feel. 
- Filtering Functionality. We want customers to be able to shop by ride (Sport, Crusier, ADV, Dirt).
- Product Rating and Comment Functionality for each product.
- Login functionality for exsisting accounts. Register functionality for new customers. 
- I want customers to also have the option to log out as guest if they don't have or want to register an account. 
- Customer should have a view of shopping cart on every page. Pages should have drop down functionality if customer hovers mouse over the cart. 
- Checkout page/process made simple. Very simple for the customer to complete.
- Email system, that sends an email right after a purchase. Also used for updated shipping information and requesting product reviews.
- Video Capatible, for product reviews. If we have a review for a product, that video should have be placed somewhere on the individual product page(the page that appears when one item is clicked). 
- Search functionality for all products.
- Admin page so that we can control the content of the page. (i.e. add products, change products, list promotions)
